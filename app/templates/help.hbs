<h1>Scoring Basics</h1>
<p>Here's a quick guide to get you started with how to start scoring a game using Fieldr:</p>
<h2>Inning</h2>
<p>Enter the inning that the plate appearance occured, keeping in mind whether it is the top or bottom. The away team bats in the top of the inning, the home team bats in the bottom.</p>

<h2>Pitcher/Batter Numbers</h2>
<p>Enter the jersey number of the pitcher and batter.</p>

<h2>Batter Result</h2>
<p>This is how the batter is scored for each plate appearance. It is important to note that outs and hits scored here do not necessarily reflect outs recorded against the team or whether the batter safely reaches base. These are the options:</p>
<div class='indent'>
<h3>No AB</h3>
<p>A batter does not get an official AB (At Bat) in the event of a walk or hit by pitch, or if the third out of the inning was recorded before the completion of the plate appearance, such as in the case of a baserunner being caught stealing.</p>
<h3>Hit</h3>
<p>A batter gets a hit when they reach base safely without the aid of a defensive error. A batter is still credited with a hit if they get out on the bases while unsuccessfully trying to advance beyond first base.</p>
<h3>Out</h3>
<p>A batter gets an out if they strike out, ground out, or fly/line/pop out. A batter is still given an out if they reach base safely due to a defensive error or in the event of a fielder's choice (where another baserunner is forced out on the play, but the batter reaches safely). As such, an out scored against a batter does not necessarily result in an out recorded against the team.</p>
</div>
<h2>Runs</h2>
<p>A run is recorded for every baserunner to safely cross home as a result of the plate appearance.</p>

<h2>Errors</h2>
<p>An error is recorded when a defender makes a mistake, such as dropping the ball or missing a throw, that results in a runner being safe when they should be out.</p>

<h2>Outs</h2>
<p>This field is to record outs that are recorded against the home team during and as a result of the plate appearance, including baserunners being caught on the basepaths before the conclusion of the plate appearance.</p>
